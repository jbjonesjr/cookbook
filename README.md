cookbook
========

This project stores code and asset snippets, samples, and scripts that are used with the cookbook blog.  Since many of the entries to describe actions to take, I've tried to make many of the common ones available here.  The idea is why type them in by hand when the scripts can be made available as well.  

This also ise my personal repository of tools as well.
